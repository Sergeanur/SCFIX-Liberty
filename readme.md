# SCFIX-Liberty

SCFIX-Liberty aims to provide bugfixes to the original scripts. Based off of [UndefinifiedLiberty](https://github.com/Sergeanur/UndefinifiedLiberty).

All changes to the scripts were marked with `SCFIX` comment.

Currently in beta status.

## Save files compatibility

At this point it's incompatible with old save files made with original scm. In future it's possible to come up with a save file converter once a stable release will be decided upon.

## How to compile

You need to get miss2.exe from 3master and then patch the 3master plague out of it.
To patch miss2.exe, put it in `patch` directory and launch **xdelta3.bat**. Now you can use miss2.exe that would produce correct compiled binaries.
